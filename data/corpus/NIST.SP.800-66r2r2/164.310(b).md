## Physical Safeguards

### Workstation Use (§ 164.310(b))

**HIPAA Standard:** Implement policies and procedures that specify the proper functions to be performed, the manner in which those functions are to be performed, and the physical attributes of the surroundings of a specific workstation or class of workstation that can access electronic protected health information.

| 1.   **Identify Workstation and Device Types  and Functions or Uses** | ·     Inventory workstations and devices that create, store, process, or  transmit ePHI. Be sure to consider the multitude of computing devices (e.g., medical equipment, IoT devices, tablets, smart  phones).  ·     Develop policies and  procedures for each  type of device and identify and accommodate  their unique issues.  ·     Classify devices based  on the capabilities, connections, and  allowable activities for each device used.  ·     Determine the proper function and manner by which specific  workstations or classes of workstations are permitted to access ePHI (e.g.,  applications permitting access to ePHI  that are allowed on workstations used by a hospital’s customer service call  center or its radiology department). | ·     Do the policies and procedures identify devices that access ePHI and those that do not?  ·     Is there an inventory of device types  and locations in the  organization?  ·    Who is responsible for this inventory and its maintenance?  ·     What tasks are commonly performed on a given  device or type of device?  ·     Are all types  of computing devices used as workstations identified along with the  use of these devices?  ·     Are all devices that create, store,  process, or transmit ePHI owned by the regulated entity?  ·     Are some devices  personally owned or owned by another  party?  ·    Has the organization considered the use of automation to manage device inventory? |
| 2.   **Identify the Expected  Performance of Each Type of Workstation and Device** | ·     Develop and document policies and procedures related to the  proper use and performance of devices that create, store, process, or  transmit ePHI. | ·    How are these devices  used in day-to-day operations?  ·    Which devices are involved in various work  activities?  ·     What are key operational risks  that could result  in a breach of security?  ·     Do the policies and procedures address the use of these  devices for any personal use?  ·     Has the organization updated training and awareness content to include the proper use and performance of  these devices? |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3.   **Analyze Physical Surroundings for Physical Attributes**[98](#_bookmark83) | ·     Ensure that any risks associated with a device’s surroundings are  known and analyzed for possible  negative impacts.  ·     Develop policies and procedures that will prevent or preclude the  unauthorized access of unattended devices, limit the ability of unauthorized persons  to view sensitive information, and dispose of  sensitive information as needed. | ·     Do the policies and procedures specify where to place devices to only allow  viewing by authorized personnel?  ·    Where are devices located?  ·    Where does work on ePHI occur?  ·     Are some devices  stationary?  ·    Are some devices mobile  and leave the physical facility?  ·     Is viewing by unauthorized individuals restricted or limited on these devices?  ·     Do changes need to be made in the space  configuration?  ·     Do workforce members understand the security requirements for the data  they use in their day-to-day jobs?  ·    Are any computing  components (e.g., servers, workstations. medical devices) kept in locations that put the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI at risk? |
