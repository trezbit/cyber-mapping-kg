### Evaluation (§ 164.308(a)(8))

**HIPAA Standard:** Perform a periodic technical and nontechnical evaluation, based initially upon the standards implemented under this rule and subsequently, in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of electronic protected health information, that establishes the extent to which a covered entity’s or business associate’s security policies and procedures meet the requirements of this subpart.

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Determine Whether  Internal or External  Evaluation is Most Appropriate** | ·    Decide whether the evaluation will  be conducted with internal staff resources or  external consultants.  ·    Engage external expertise to assist  the internal evaluation team where additional skills  and expertise are  determined to be reasonable and appropriate.  ·     Use internal resources to supplement an external source of help because these  internal resources can provide the best institutional knowledge and  history of internal policies and practices. | ·     Which staff has the technical experience and expertise to evaluate the systems?  ·     Are the evaluators sufficiently independent to provide  objective reporting?  ·     How much training will staff need  on security-related  technical and non-technical issues?  ·     If an outside vendor is used, what factors should be considered when  selecting the vendor, such as credentials and experience?  ·     What is the  budget for internal resources to assist  with an evaluation?  ·    What is the budget  for external services to assist with  an evaluation? |
| 2.   **Develop Standards and  Measurements for Reviewing All Standards and Implementation Specifications of the  Security Rule**[79](#_bookmark62) | ·     Develop and document organizational policies and procedures[80](#_bookmark63) for conducting  evaluation.  ·     Once security controls have been implemented in response to the  organization’s risk assessment and management processes, periodically review  these implemented security measures to ensure their  continued effectiveness in protecting ePHI.  ·    Consider determining any  specific evaluation metrics and/or measurements to be captured during evaluation. | ·     Has the organization documented policies and procedures  for conducting the evaluation of security controls?  ·     Have management, operational, and technical issues  been considered?  ·     Do the elements of each evaluation procedure (e.g., questions, statements, or other components) address individual, measurable security safeguards for ePHI?  ·    Has the organization developed evaluation procedures  that capture any desired metrics or measurements? |

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                             | Metrics and/or  measurements can assist  in tracking progress over  time.  ·     Use an evaluation strategy and tool that considers all elements of the HIPAA  Security Rule and  can be tracked, such as a questionnaire or  checklist.  ·     Implement tools that  can provide reports  on the level  of compliance, integration, or maturity of a particular security  safeguard deployed to protect ePHI.  ·     If available, consider engaging corporate, legal, or regulatory compliance staff when conducting the analysis.  ·     Leverage any existing reports or documentation that may already be  prepared by the organization addressing the compliance, integration, or  maturity of a particular  security safeguard deployed to protect ePHI. | ·     Has the organization determined that the procedure must be tested in a few areas or  systems?  ·     Does the evaluation tool consider all standards and implementation specifications of the HIPAA  Security Rule?  ·     Does the evaluation tool address the protection of ePHI  that is collected, used, or disclosed? |
| 3.   **Conduct Evaluation** | ·     Determine in advance what departments and/or  staff will participate in  the evaluation.  ·     Determine what constitutes an environmental or operational change  that affects the security of ePHI.  ·     Determine when evaluations are conducted in response to an environmental or operational  change that affects the security of ePHI (e.g., prior to the change,  contemporaneous with the change, after the change).  ·     Secure management support  for the evaluation process to ensure  participation.  ·     Collect and document all needed information. Collection methods may  include the use of interviews, surveys, and the outputs of automated tools,  such as access control auditing tools, system  logs, and the results of penetration  testing.  ·     Conduct penetration testing  (where testers attempt  to compromise system security for the sole purpose of testing the  effectiveness of security controls), if reasonable and appropriate.  ·    Evaluation may include  reviewing organizational policies and procedures, assessing the implementation of security | ·     If available, have staff members with knowledge of IT security been  consulted and included in the evaluation team?  ·     Are appropriate personnel notified of planned environmental or operational changes that could affect the security of ePHI?  ·     Is a change management process in place that includes identification  and communication of environmental and operational changes that could  affect the security of ePHI?  ·     If penetration testing has been determined to be reasonable and  appropriate, has specifically worded, written approval from senior  management been received for any planned penetration  testing?  ·     Has the process been formally communicated to those who have  been assigned roles  and responsibilities in the  evaluation process?  ·     Has the organization explored the use of automated tools to support the evaluation process? |

| 4.   **Document Results**                | ·     Document each evaluation finding as well  as remediation options,  recommendations, and decisions.  ·     Document known gaps  between identified risks,  mitigating security controls, and any acceptance of risk, including justification.  ·     Develop security program  priorities and establish targets for continuous improvement.  ·     Utilize the results of evaluations to inform impactful security changes to protect  ePHI.  ·    Communicate evaluation  results, metrics, and/or measurements to relevant organizational personnel. | ·     Does the process support the development of security recommendations?  ·     When determining how best to display evaluation results, have written reports that highlight key findings and  recommendations been considered?  ·     If a written  final report is to be circulated among  key staff, have steps been  taken to ensure that it is made available only to those persons designated to  receive it?  ·    Does the  organization use evaluation results to enhance the protection of ePHI rather  than for the sake of compliance? |
| 5.   **Repeat Evaluations Periodically** | ·     Establish the frequency of evaluations. Consider the sensitivity of the ePHI  controlled by the organization as well as the organization’s size,  complexity, and environmental and/or operational changes (e.g., other  relevant laws or accreditation requirements).  ·     In addition to periodic reevaluations, consider repeating evaluations when environmental and operational changes that affect the security of ePHI  are made to the organization (e.g., if new technology is adopted or if there  are newly recognized risks to the security of ePHI). | ·     Do security policies specify that evaluations will be repeated when  environmental and operational changes are made that affect the security of ePHI?  ·     Do policies on the frequency of security evaluations reflect any and all relevant federal or state laws that bear  on environmental or operational changes affecting the security of ePHI?  ·     Has the organization explored the use of automated tools to support periodic evaluations? |
