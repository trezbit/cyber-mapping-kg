| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Isolate Healthcare Clearinghouse Functions**[54](#_bookmark33)  **Implementation Specification  (Required)** | ·     *If a healthcare  clearinghouse is part of a larger organization, the clearinghouse must  implement policies and procedures that  protect the ePHI  of the clearinghouse from unauthorized access  by the larger organization.*  ·    Determine whether a component of the regulated entity constitutes a healthcare clearinghouse under the HIPAA  Security Rule.  ·     If no clearinghouse functions exist, document this finding. If a  clearinghouse exists within the organization, implement procedures for access that  are consistent with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. | ·     If healthcare clearinghouse functions are performed, are policies and procedures implemented to protect ePHI  from the other functions of the larger organization?  ·     Does the healthcare clearinghouse share hardware or software with  a larger organization of which it is a part?  ·     Does the healthcare clearinghouse share staff  or physical space with  staff from a larger organization?  ·     Has a separate network or subsystem been established for the healthcare clearinghouse, if  reasonable and appropriate?  ·     Has staff of the healthcare clearinghouse been trained to safeguard ePHI  from disclosure to the larger  organization, if required for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule? |
| 2.   **Implement Policies and  Procedures for Authorizing Access**     **Implementation Specification  (Addressable)** | ·     *Implement policies and  procedures for granting access to ePHI, such as through access  to a workstation, transaction,  program, process, or other mechanism.*  ·     Decide and document procedures for how access to ePHI  will be granted to workforce members within the organization.  ·    Select the basis for  restricting access to ePHI.  ·     Select an access  control method (e.g.,  identity-based, role- based,  or other reasonable and appropriate means of access.)  ·    Decide and document how access to ePHI will  be granted for privileged  functions. | ·     Have appropriate authorization and clearance procedures, as specified in [Workforce Security](#_bookmark26) (§ 164.308(a)(3)), been performed prior to  granting access?  ·     Do the organization’s systems have the capacity to set  access controls?[55](#_bookmark34)  ·    Are there documented job  descriptions that accurately reflect assigned duties and responsibilities and enforce  segregation of duties?[56](#_bookmark35)  ·    Has the organization documented procedures that specify how authorized personnel will  be granted access  to ePHI?  ·    Does the organization grant  remote access to ePHI? |

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                                                              | ·    Ensure that  there is a list of personnel with  authority to approve user  requests to access ePHI and  systems with ePHI.  ·     Identify authorized users  with access to ePHI, including data owners and data  custodians.  ·     Consider whether multiple access control methods are needed to protect ePHI according to the results of the risk assessment.  ·    Determine whether direct  access to ePHI will ever be appropriate for individuals external to the  organization (e.g., business partners or patients seeking  access to their own ePHI). | ·    What methods of access control  are used (e.g.,  identity- based, role-based, location-based, or a combination) to  protect ePHI?  ·     Are there additional access control requirements for users who will  be accessing privileged functions?  ·     Have organizational personnel been explicitly authorized to approve user requests to  access ePHI and/or systems with ePHI? |
| 3.   **Implement Policies and  Procedures for Access Establishment and Modification**  **Implementation Specification  (Addressable)** | ·     *Implement policies and  procedures that – based on the covered entity or business associate’s access authorization  policies – establish, document, review,  and modify a user's  right of access to a workstation, transaction, program, or process.*  ·    Establish standards for granting access  to ePHI.  ·     Provide formal authorization from the appropriate authority before granting  access to ePHI.  ·     Regularly review personnel access to ePHI  to ensure that access is still authorized and  needed  ·     Modify personnel access  to ePHI, as needed, based  on review activities. | ·     Are duties separated such that only the minimum necessary ePHI  is made available to each workforce member based on their job  requirements?  ·     Are access decisions justified, approved, logged,  and retained?  ·     Is personnel access  to ePHI regularly reviewed to ensure that access is still authorized  and needed?  ·    Are activities that review  access to ePHI  logged and retained, including decisions that arise  from review activities?  ·    Are decisions related to  the establishment and modification of workforce member authorization to access  ePHI documented? |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4.   **Evaluate Existing  Security Measures Related to Access  Controls**[57](#_bookmark36) | ·     Evaluate the security features of access  controls that are already in place or those of any  planned for implementation, as appropriate.  ·     Determine whether these security features involve alignment with  other existing management, operational, and  technical controls, such  as policy standards, personnel procedures, the maintenance and review of audit  trails, the identification and  authentication of users,  and physical  access controls. | ·     Are there policies and procedures related  to the security of access controls?[58](#_bookmark37) If so, are they updated  regularly?  ·     Are authentication mechanisms used to verify  the identity of those  accessing systems protected from inappropriate manipulation?[59](#_bookmark38)  ·     Does management regularly review the list of access authorizations, including remote access authorizations, to verify that the list is accurate and has not been  inappropriately altered?[60](#_bookmark39) |
