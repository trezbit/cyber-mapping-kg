| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Determine the  Goals of an Incident Response**        | ·     Gain an understanding as to what constitutes a true security  incident. Under the HIPAA Security Rule, a security incident is the attempted  or successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or  destruction of information or interference with system operations in an information system (45 CFR  § 164.304).  ·     Ensure that the incident response program covers all parts  of the organization in which ePHI is created, stored, processed, or  transmitted.  ·     Determine how the organization will  respond to a security  incident.  ·     Establish a reporting mechanism and a process to coordinate responses to the security  incident.  ·    Provide direct technical  assistance, advise vendors to address product-related problems, and provide liaisons to legal and criminal investigative groups, as needed. | ·     Has the HIPAA-required security risk assessment resulted in a list of potential physical or technological  events that could lead to a breach of security?  ·     Is there a procedure in place for reporting and handling  incidents?  ·     Has an analysis been conducted that relates reasonably anticipated  organizational threats (that could result in a security incident) to the methods that would be used for mitigation?  ·     Have the key functions of the organization been prioritized to  determine what would need to be restored first in the event of a disruption?[69](#_bookmark50) |
| 2.   **Develop and  Deploy an Incident Response Team or Other  Reasonable and Appropriate Response Mechanism** | ·     Determine whether the size, scope, mission, and other aspects of the organization justify the reasonableness and appropriateness of maintaining a standing incident  response team.  ·     Identify appropriate individuals to be part of a formal incident response team if the organization has  determined that implementing an incident response team is reasonable  and appropriate.  ·     Consider assigning secondary personnel to be part of the  incident response team in the event that primary  personnel are  unavailable. | ·     Do members of the team  have adequate knowledge of the  organization’s hardware and software?  ·     Do members of the team  have the authority to speak for the organization to the media, law  enforcement, and clients or business partners?  ·     Has the incident response team received appropriate training in incident response activities? |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3. **Develop and  Implement Policy and Procedures to Respond to and Report Security Incidents**     **Implementation Specification  (Required)** | ·     *Identify and respond to  suspected or known security incidents; mitigate, to the extent practicable,  harmful effects of security incidents that are known to the covered entity or business associate;  and document security incidents and their outcomes.*  ·    Ensure that  an organizational incident response policy[70](#_bookmark51) is in place that addresses  all parts of the organization in which ePHI is created, stored, processed, or  transmitted.  ·     Document incident response procedures that can provide  a single point of reference to guide the day-to-day operations of the  incident response team.  ·     Review incident response procedures with staff  who have roles and  responsibilities related to incident response; solicit suggestions for  improvements; and make changes to reflect input, if reasonable and  appropriate.  ·    Consider conducting tests of the incident response plan.  ·     Update the procedures as required based  on changing organizational  needs.[71](#_bookmark52) | ·     Has the organization determined that maintaining a staffed security incident hotline would  be reasonable and appropriate?  ·     Has the organization developed processes for documenting and tracking incidents?  ·     Has the organization determined reasonable and appropriate mitigation options for security incidents?  ·     Has the organization developed standardized incident report templates to record necessary information related  to incidents?  ·     Has the organization determined that information captured in the reporting templates is reasonable and appropriate to investigate an incident?  ·     Has the organization determined the conditions under which information related to a security breach will be  disclosed to the media?  ·     Have appropriate (internal and external) persons who should be informed of a security breach been identified? Has a contact information  list been prepared?  ·     Has a written  incident response plan  been developed and provided to the incident response  team?  ·    Has the incident response plan been tested? |
| 4. **Incorporate Post-Incident Analysis Into  Updates and Revisions** | ·     Measure effectiveness and update security incident response  procedures to reflect lessons learned and identify actions to take  that will improve security controls  after a security incident.  ·     Incidents caused by or influenced by known risks  should feed back into the risk assessment process for a reevaluation  of impact and/or likelihood.  ·     Remediation and corrective action plans that  arise from incidents should  serve as input to the risk assessment/management process. | ·     Has the organization analyzed records (e.g., log files, malware) to understand the nature, extent,  and scope of the incident?  ·     Does the organization reassess risk to ePHI based  on findings from this analysis?  ·     Does the incident response team keep adequate documentation of security incidents and their outcomes, which may include what  weaknesses were exploited and how access to the information was gained?  ·    Do records reflect the new contacts and resources  identified for responding to an incident? |
