## Technical Safeguards

### Transmission Security (§ 164.312(e)(1))

**HIPAA Standard:** Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to electronic protected health information that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network.

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Identify Any Possible  Unauthorized Sources That  May Be Able to Intercept and/or Modify the Information** | ·     Identify all pathways by which ePHI  will be transmitted into, within, and outside of  the organization.  ·     Identify scenarios (e.g.,  telehealth, claims processing) that may result in access to or modification of the ePHI by  unauthorized sources during transmission (e.g., hackers, disgruntled  employees, business competitors).[142](#_bookmark132)  ·     Identify scenarios and pathways that  may put ePHI  at a high level of risk. | ·     Have all pathways by which ePHI  will be transmitted (e.g., file transfers, email, web portals, mobile apps,  communications with servers or databases containing ePHI, online tracking)  been identified?  ·     Has a risk assessment been used to determine transmission pathways and scenarios that  may pose high risk to ePHI?  ·     What measures exist  to protect ePHI  in transmission?  ·     Have appropriate protection mechanisms been identified for all scenarios and  pathways by which ePHI is transmitted?  ·     Is there an auditing process  in place to verify that  ePHI has been protected  against unauthorized access during transmission?[143](#_bookmark133)  ·    Are there trained workforce members to monitor transmissions? |
| 2.   **Develop and Implement  Transmission Security Policy  and Procedures** | ·     Establish a formal  written set of requirements for transmitting ePHI.  ·     Identify methods of transmission that  will be used to  safeguard ePHI.  ·     Identify tools and techniques that  will be used  to support the transmission  security policy.  ·    Implement procedures for transmitting ePHI  using hardware and/or software, if needed. | ·     Have the requirements been discussed and agreed to by  identified key personnel involved in transmitting ePHI?  ·     Has a written  policy been developed and communicated to system users? |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3.   **Implement Integrity Controls**  **Implementation Specification  (Addressable)** | ·     *Implement security measures to ensure  that electronically  transmitted ePHI is not improperly modified without detection until disposed  of.* | ·     What security measures are currently used to protect ePHI during transmission?  ·     What measures are  planned to protect  ePHI in transmission?  ·    Is there assurance that  information is not altered during transmission? |
| 4.   **Implement Encryption**  **Implementation Specification  (Addressable)** | ·     *Implement a mechanism to encrypt ePHI whenever  appropriate.* | ·    Is encryption reasonable and appropriate to protect ePHI in transmission?  ·    Based on the risk  assessment, is encryption needed to  effectively protect the information from unauthorized  access during transmission?  ·     Has the organization considered the use of email encryption and automated confidentiality statements when emailing outside of the organization?  ·     Is encryption feasible and cost-effective in this  environment?  ·     What encryption algorithms and mechanisms are available?  ·    Are available encryption algorithms and mechanisms of sufficient strength to protect electronically transmitted  ePHI?  ·     Is electronic transmission hardware/software configured  so that the strength of encryption used in transmitting ePHI cannot be  weakened?  ·     Have all applications used on devices that support the provisioning of health services been assessed to verify that strong transmission security is  implemented?  ·     Does the covered  entity have the appropriate staff  to maintain a process for encrypting ePHI during transmission?  ·    Are workforce members skilled  in the use of encryption? |
