| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Develop a Contingency Planning Policy**[73](#_bookmark55) | ·    Define the organization’s overall contingency objectives.  ·     Establish the organizational framework, roles, and responsibilities for this area.  ·     Address scope, resource requirements, training, testing, plan maintenance, and backup  requirements. | ·     What critical services must be provided within specified  time frames?  o  Patient treatment, for example, may need to be  performed without disruption.  o  By  contrast, claims processing may be delayed during an emergency with  no long-term damage to the organization.  ·     Have cross-functional dependencies been identified to determine how a failure in one  system may negatively  impact another one? |
| 2.   **Conduct an Applications and Data Criticality Analysis**[74](#_bookmark56)  **Implementation Specification  (Addressable)** | ·     *Assess the relative criticality of specific applications and data in support of other Contingency Plan components.*  ·     Identify the activities and material involving ePHI that are critical to business operations.  ·     Identify the critical services or operations and the manual and automated processes that  support them involving ePHI.  ·     Determine the amount  of time that  the organization can tolerate disruptions to these  operations, materials, or services (e.g., due to power outages).  ·     Evaluate the current  and available levels  of redundancy and geographic  distribution of any storage service providers to identify risks to service  availability and  determine restoration times. | ·     What hardware, software, and personnel are critical to daily operations?  ·     What is the  impact on desired service levels if these critical assets are not available?  ·     What, if any, support is provided by external providers (e.g., cloud  service providers, internet service providers,  utilities, or contractors)?  ·    What is the nature  and degree of impact on the operation if any of the critical resources or service providers are not available?  ·    Has the organization identified vendors or service providers that are critical to business operations? |

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |

|                                                              | ·     Consider whether any vendor/service provider arrangements are  critical to operations and address them as appropriate to ensure  availability and reliability.  ·    Establish cost-effective strategies for recovering these critical services or processes. | ·     Has the organization sufficiently addressed the availability  and reliability of these services (e.g., via service-level agreements,  contracts)? |
| 3.   **Identify Preventive Measures**[75](#_bookmark57)      | ·     Identify preventive measures for each defined scenario that could  result in the  loss of a critical service  operation involving the use of ePHI.  ·     Ensure that identified preventive measures are practical  and feasible in terms of their applicability in a given environment. | ·     What alternatives for continuing operations of the organization are  available in case  of the loss  of any critical function or resource?  ·     What is the cost associated with the preventive measures that may be considered?  ·     Are the preventive measures feasible (i.e.,  affordable and practical  for the environment)?  ·    What plans, procedures, or  agreements need to be initiated to enable  the implementation of the preventive measures if they are  necessary? |
| 4.   **Develop Recovery Strategy**[76](#_bookmark58)         | ·     Finalize the set of contingency procedures that should be invoked for  all identified impacts, including emergency mode operation. The strategy must  be adaptable to the existing operating environment and address allowable  outage times and  the associated priorities identified in Key Activity 2.  ·    If part of the strategy depends  on external organizations for support, ensure that  formal agreements are in place with specific requirements stated. | ·     Have procedures related to recovery from  emergency or disastrous  events been documented?  ·     Has a coordinator who manages, maintains, and updates the  plan been designated?  ·     Has an emergency call list been distributed to all workforce members? Have recovery procedures been documented?  ·    Has a determination been  made regarding when the plan needs to be activated (e.g.,  anticipated duration of outage,  tolerances for outage or loss of capability, impact on service delivery)? |
| 5.   **Data Backup  Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan**  **Implementation Specifications  (Both Required)** | ·     *Establish and  implement procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies  of ePHI.*  ·     *Establish (and  implement as needed) procedures to restore any loss of data.* | ·     Is there a formal, written contingency plan? Does  it address disaster recovery and data backup?[77](#_bookmark59)  ·     Does the disaster recovery plan address what data is to be restored and in what order?  ·    Do data backup procedures exist that include  all ePHI? |
