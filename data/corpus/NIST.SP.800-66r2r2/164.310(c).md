## Physical Safeguards

### Workstation Security (§ 164.310(c))

**HIPAA Standard:** Implement physical safeguards for all workstations that access electronic protected health information, to restrict access to authorized users.

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Identify All Methods of Physical  Access to Workstations and Devices** | ·     Document the different ways that users access workstations and  other devices that  create, store, process, or transmit ePHI. Be sure to  consider the multitude of computing devices (e.g., medical equipment, IoT  devices, tablets, smart phones).  ·    Consider any mobile devices  that leave the physical facility as well as remote workers who access devices that create, store,  process, or transmit ePHI. | ·    Is there an inventory of all current device locations?  ·    Are any devices located in public areas?  ·     Are laptops or other computing devices used as workstations to create, access, store, process, or transmit  ePHI? |
| 2.   **Analyze the Risks Associated with Each Type of Access**[99](#_bookmark84) | ·     Determine which type of access  identified in Key Activity 1 poses the greatest threat to the  security of ePHI. | ·    Do any devices leave  the facility?  ·     Are any devices  housed in areas  that are more vulnerable  to unauthorized use, theft, or viewing of the data they contain?  ·    What are the options  for modifying the current access configuration to protect ePHI? |
| 3. **Identify and Implement  Physical Safeguards for Workstations and Devices** | ·     Implement physical safeguards and other security measures to minimize the  possibility of inappropriate access to ePHI through  computing devices.  ·     If there are impediments to physically securing devices and/or the facilities where  devices are located, additional safeguards should be considered, such as:  o  Limiting device  capabilities to access  ePHI  o    Limiting user permissions to access ePHI  o    Device encryption  o    Stringent access controls (e.g., multi-factor  authentication [MFA])  o    Screen lock | ·     Are physical safeguards implemented for all devices that access ePHI to restrict access to  authorized users?  ·     Are devices and other tools used in the provisioning of treatment,  payment, and operations protected from unauthorized access, viewing, modification, and/or theft  within mobile healthcare environments?  ·     What safeguards are in place,(e.g., locked doors, screen barriers, cameras, guards)?[100](#_bookmark85)  ·     Are additional physical safeguards needed to protect  devices with ePHI?  ·    Do any devices need to be relocated to enhance physical security? |

| **Key Activities** | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                    | o  Device  management (e.g., mobile device management  [MDM], endpoint detection and response [EDR])  o  Workforce education and training related  to mobile and remote computing risks to ePHI | ·     Are safeguards such  as anti-theft devices, physical privacy  screens, or other procedures used to help prevent unauthorized audio and  video recording?  ·    Have workforce members been trained on security?[101](#_bookmark86)  ·     Are some devices not owned by the organization? Do these ownership considerations preclude the use of any  physical security controls on the device?  ·     Do the policies and procedures specify the use of additional security measures to protect devices with ePHI, such as using privacy screens,  enabling password-  protected screen savers, or logging off the device? |
