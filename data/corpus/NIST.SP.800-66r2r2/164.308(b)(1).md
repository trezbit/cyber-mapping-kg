## Administrative Safeguards

### Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements (§ 164.308(b)(1))

**HIPAA Standard:** A covered entity may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected health information on the covered entity’s behalf only if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with § 164.314(a), that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information. A covered entity is not required to obtain such satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.

Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to organizations. However, to the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as covered entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written satisfactory assurances that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a business associate agreement (BAA). These requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate.

If so, where will such additional  assurances be documented (e.g., in the BAA, service-level agreement, or other  documentation)? and how will they be met (e.g., providing documentation of  implemented safeguards, audits,  certifications)? |
