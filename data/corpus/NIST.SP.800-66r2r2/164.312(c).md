## Technical Safeguards

### Integrity (§ 164.312(c))

**HIPAA Standard:** Implement policies and procedures to protect electronic protected health information from improper alteration or destruction.

**Table 23. Key activities, descriptions, and sample questions for the Integrity standard**

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Identify All  Users Who Have Been Authorized to Access ePHI**[127](#_bookmark115) | ·     Identify all approved users with the ability to alter or destroy ePHI, if reasonable and  appropriate.  ·     Address this Key Activity in conjunction with the identification of unauthorized sources in Key Activity 2. | ·    How are users authorized to access the information?[128](#_bookmark116)  ·    Is there a sound  basis for why they need  the access?[129](#_bookmark117)  ·    Have they  been trained on how to use the information?[130](#_bookmark118)  ·    Is there an audit  trail established for all accesses to the information?[131](#_bookmark119) |
| 2.   **Identify Any Possible  Unauthorized Sources That  May Be Able to Intercept the Information and Modify It** | ·     Identify scenarios that may result in modification to the ePHI by unauthorized sources (e.g., hackers, ransomware, insider threats, business  competitors, user errors).[132](#_bookmark120)  ·    Conduct this  activity as part of a risk analysis.[133](#_bookmark121)  ·     Consider how the organization will  detect unauthorized  modification to ePHI. | ·     What are likely  sources that could  jeopardize information integrity?[134](#_bookmark122)  ·     What can be done to protect the integrity of the information when it is residing in a system  (at rest)?  ·     What procedures and policies can be established to decrease or prevent alteration of the information during transmission?[135](#_bookmark123)  ·    What options  exist to detect  the unauthorized  modification of ePHI? |
| 3.   **Develop the  Integrity Policy and Requirements**      | ·     Establish a formal  written set of integrity requirements based on the results of  the analysis completed in Key Activities 1 and 2. | ·     Have the requirements been discussed and agreed to by identified key personnel involved in the processes that are affected?  ·    Have the requirements been  documented?  ·    Has a written policy  been developed and  communicated to personnel? |

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4.   **Implement Procedures to  Address These Requirements** | ·     Identify and implement methods that will  be used to protect ePHI from unauthorized  modification.  ·     Identify and implement tools and techniques to be developed or procured that  support the assurance of integrity. | ·    Are current audit, logging, and access control techniques sufficient to address the integrity of ePHI?  ·    If not, what additional techniques (e.g., quality control  process, transaction and output reconstruction) can be utilized to  check the integrity of ePHI?  ·     Are technical solutions in place to prevent and detect the malicious alteration or destruction  of ePHI (e.g., anti- malware, anti-ransomware, file integrity monitoring solutions)?  ·    Can the additional training of users decrease instances attributable to human errors? |
| 5.   **Implement a Mechanism to Authenticate ePHI**  **Implementation Specification  (Addressable)** | ·     *Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that ePHI has not  been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.*  ·     Consider possible mechanisms for integrity verification, such as:  o    Error-correcting memory  o    Digital signatures | ·     Are the uses  of both electronic and non-electronic  mechanisms necessary for the protection of ePHI?  ·    Are appropriate electronic authentication tools available?  ·     Are available electronic authentication tools interoperable with other applications  and system components?  ·    If ePHI is detected as altered by unauthorized users  or improperly altered by authorized users,  is a process in place to  respond?  ·    Is this response process tied to organizational incident management processes? |
| 6.   **Establish a Monitoring Process  to Assess How the Implemented Process is Working** | ·     Review existing processes to determine whether objectives are being addressed.[136](#_bookmark124)  ·     Continually reassess integrity processes as technology and operational environments change to determine whether they  need to be revised.[137](#_bookmark125) | ·     Are there reported instances of information integrity problems? Have they decreased since integrity procedures were implemented?[138](#_bookmark126)  ·    Does the process, as implemented, provide a higher level of assurance that information  integrity is being maintained? |
