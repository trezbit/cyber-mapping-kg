### **Business Associate Contracts or Other Arrangements (§ 164.314(a))**

**HIPAA Standard:** (i) The contract or other arrangement between the covered entity and its business associate required by § 164.308(b)(3) must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), or (a)(2)(iii) of this section, as applicable. (ii) A covered entity is in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it has another arrangement in place that meets the requirements of § 164.504(e)(3). (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section apply to the contract or other arrangement between a business associate and a subcontractor required by § 164.308(b)(4) in the same manner as such requirements apply to contracts or other arrangements between a covered entity and business associate.

Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to organizations. To the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as covered entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written satisfactory assurances from business associates that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a BAA. These requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate.
