| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Determine the Activities That Will Be Tracked or Audited** | ·    Determine the appropriate  scope of audit controls that will be necessary in information systems that  contain or use ePHI based  on the regulated entity’s risk assessment and other organizational  factors.[120](#_bookmark108)  ·     Determine what activities need to be captured using  the results of the risk assessment and risk management processes. | ·    Where is ePHI at risk in the organization?[121](#_bookmark109)  ·     What systems, applications, or processes make ePHI vulnerable to unauthorized or inappropriate tampering, uses, or disclosures?[122](#_bookmark110)  ·    What activities will be  audited (e.g., creating ePHI, accessing ePHI, modifying ePHI, transmitting ePHI,  and/or deleting files or records that contain ePHI)?  ·     What should the audit record include (e.g., user responsible for the activity; event type, date,  or time)?  ·    Are audit records generated for all systems/devices that create, store, process, or transmit ePHI? |
| 2.   **Select the Tools That  Will Be Deployed for  Auditing and System Activity Reviews** | ·     Evaluate existing system  capabilities and determine whether any changes or  upgrades are necessary. | ·    What tools  are in place?  ·     What are the most appropriate monitoring tools for the  organization (e.g., third-party, freeware, or operating system-provided)?  ·    Are changes/upgrades to information systems reasonable  and appropriate? |
| 3.   **Develop and Deploy the  Information System Activity Review/Audit Policy** | ·     Document and communicate to the workforce the organization’s decisions on audits and reviews. | ·     Who is responsible for the overall  audit process and results?  ·    How often will audits  take place?  ·    How often will audit  results be analyzed?  ·     What is the organization’s sanction policy for employee violations?[123](#_bookmark111)  ·    Where will  audit information reside  (e.g., separate server)? |

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4.   **Develop Appropriate Standard Operating Procedures**[124](#_bookmark112) | ·     Determine the types  of audit trail  data and monitoring procedures that will be  needed to derive exception reports.  ·     Determine the frequency of audit log reviews based  on the risk assessment and  risk management processes. | ·    How will exception reports or logs be reviewed?  ·     Has the organization considered the use of automation to assist in the monitoring and review of system activity?  ·     Are the organization’s monitoring system activity and logs reviewed  frequently enough to sufficiently protect ePHI?  ·    Where will  monitoring reports be filed and maintained?  ·     Is there a formal process in place to address system misuse, abuse, and fraudulent  activity?[125](#_bookmark113)  ·    How will managers and employees be notified, when appropriate, regarding suspect  activity? |
| 5.   **Implement the Audit/System  Activity Review Process**[126](#_bookmark114) | ·    Activate the necessary audit  system.  ·    Begin logging and auditing procedures. | ·     What mechanisms (e.g.,  metrics) will be implemented to assess the effectiveness of the audit  process?  ·    What is the plan  to revise the audit process  when needed? |
