**HIPAA Standard:** Implement procedures to verify that a person or entity seeking access to electronic protected health information is the one claimed.

| **Key Activities**                                           | **Description**                                              | **Sample Questions**                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   **Determine Authentication Applicability to Current Systems/Applications** | ·     Identify the methods  available for authentication. Under the HIPAA Security Rule, authentication is the  corroboration that a person is the one  claimed (45 CFR §  164.304).  ·     Identify points of electronic access  that require or should  require authentication. Ensure  that the regulated entity’s risk analysis properly assesses risks for such access  points (e.g., risks of unauthorized access from within the enterprise  could be different than those of remote unauthorized access).  ·     Authentication requires establishing the validity of a transmission source  and/or verifying an individual’s claim that they have been authorized  for specific access privileges to information and information systems. | ·    What authentication methods are available?  ·     What are the  advantages and disadvantages of each method?  ·     Can risks of unauthorized access  be sufficiently reduced for each point of electronic  access with available authentication methods?  ·     What will it cost to implement the  available methods in the environment?  ·     Are there trained  staff who can maintain the system or should outsourced support be  considered?  ·     Are passwords being  used? If so, are they  unique to the individual?  ·    Is MFA being used?  If so, how  and where is it  implemented? |
| 2.   **Evaluate Available  Authentication Options**          | ·     Weigh the relative advantages and disadvantages of commonly used authentication approaches.  ·     There are three  commonly used authentication approaches available:  1.    Something a person knows,  such as a password  2.    Something a person has or is in possession of, such as a token (e.g., smart card, hardware  token)  3.    Some type  of biometric identification that a person provides, such as a fingerprint  ·     MFA utilizes two or more  authentication approaches to enforce stronger authentication.  ·    Consider implementing MFA solutions[140](#_bookmark129) when the risk to ePHI is sufficiently high. | ·     What are the strengths and weaknesses of each available option?  ·     Which can be best supported with assigned resources (e.g., budget/staffing)?  ·     What level of authentication is appropriate for each access to ePHI based on the assessment  of risk?  ·     Has the organization identified all instances of access to ePHI  (including by services, vendors, or application programming interfaces  [APIs]) and considered appropriate authentication requirements based on the  risk assessment? |

|                                                       |                                                              | ·     Has the organization considered MFA for  access to ePHI that poses high risk (e.g., remote  access, access to privileged functions)?  ·     Has the organization researched available MFA options  and made a selection based on risk to ePHI?  ·     Is outside vendor  support required to implement the process?  ·     Are there password-less authentication options (e.g., biometric authentication) available that can sufficiently  address the risk to ePHI? |
| 3.   **Select and Implement  Authentication Options** | ·     Consider the results of the analysis  conducted under Key Activity 2 and select  appropriate authentication methods based on the results of the risk  assessment and risk management processes.  ·     Implement the methods selected in organizational operations and  activities. | ·    Has the organization’s selection of authentication methods been made based on the results  of the risk assessment?  ·    If passwords are being  used as an authentication element, are they of sufficient length and strength to protect ePHI? Is this enforced by technical  policies?  ·    Has necessary user and support staff  training[141](#_bookmark130) been completed?  ·     Have a formal  authentication policy and  procedures been established  and communicated?  ·     Has necessary testing been completed to ensure that  the authentication system is working as prescribed?  ·     Do the procedures include ongoing system  maintenance and updates?  ·    Is the process implemented in such a way that  it does not compromise the authentication  information (e.g., password file encryption)? |
